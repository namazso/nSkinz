### nSkinz

* Use any glove model and skin combination
* Special knife animations are supported
* Knife kill feed icons are automatically replaced
* In-game configuration with [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
* Always up-to-date dynamic skins, with localized names
* Uses signature scanning and NetVar manager for dynamic offsets
* [JSON](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) based configuration saving & loading support
